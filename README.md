The eventualy plan is to have a small RPG.

Character select
  Fighter
  Arcane Spell caster
  Rogue
  Cleric

Town
  Home, for rest
  Ye olde shoppe, for selling a buying gear and potions
  Castle, for accepting simple quests such as kill 10 goblins, find 200ft of rope, etc. 
  Barn, for chicken looking or horse peepin.
  perhaps othr characters to talk with.

Dungeons
  using the five room dungeon technique
  https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/5_room/

  Entrance and Guardian: An initial challenge or obstacle that establishes the dungeon's theme and keeps casual looters out.
  Puzzle or Roleplaying Challenge: A mental or social trial that provides a change of pace from straight combat.
  Trick or Setback: A trap, red herring, or unexpected complication designed to build tension.
  Climax, Big Battle, or Conflict: The major boss fight or final confrontation of the adventure.
  Reward, Revelation, or Plot Twist: The resolution, where the players receive their loot, discover a secret.

  Eventually, One player can join with other players to complete dungeons. Either with blue tooth or hardwired or perhaps with a wifi connection.
